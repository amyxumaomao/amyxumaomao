- 👋 Hi, I’m @amyxumaomao
- 🌱 I’m interested in atmospheric chemistry and environment. During my PhD, I focused on the environmental effects of atmospheric ammonia (NH3), including developing a long-timespan high-resolution bottom-up agricultural NH3 emission inventory for China, simulating air quality and validating the pre-mentioned emission inventory with WRF-Chem model, and exploring the efficiencies of different emission reduction scenarios. Now I'm more interested about the atmospheric chemistry and climate effects of hydrogen (H2).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with you.
